# start-learning-cs50

This repository is my CS50 learning workspace. It contains lecture notes, problem sets, projects, and resources to track progress while studying Harvard's CS50 course.

Repository structure
- lectures/        — lecture notes and slides
- psets/           — problem sets (pset0, pset1, ...)
- projects/        — final projects and larger assignments
- notes/           — personal notes, summaries, cheat-sheets
- resources/       — helpful links, tools, references

Getting started
1. Follow the CS50 syllabus and create a new folder in psets/ for each problem set (e.g., psets/pset0).
2. Add your code, writeups, and any tests in the respective folder.
3. Commit often with clear messages describing changes.
